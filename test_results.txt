Come , let's go get that automobile .	2
Well , some other time , then ?	2
He's in trouble . Boy ?	4
Criminal gang unit to take control .	4
By Molto . No discussion . Interview .	1
I was coming down the steps and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet .	4
I feel rather sorry for him , don't you ?	6
Now I just drink like an Irish person .	3
Just wait and see .	2
Any friend of [PERSON]'s is a friend of mine .	8
or something ? - Fuck ! - [PERSON] .	1
You go ahead and let the grieving process happen .	8
Hey , would you like a-a flabellina oculina ?	2
I'm coming down . -[PERSON] , don't start anything .	1
He was safe .	8
And I'm gonna make you a pussycat .	1
I've a great program to try out .	2
Didn't you talk about a boys camp ?	7
That guy seems like a real piece of work .	8
Um , look , can we just forget last night ?	7
Hey , wait a minute !	7
We're so damn lost .	4
I'll be sorry to leave Faith .	6
I don't like to take mortgages from widows .	3
I'd have to kill myself .	4
I know , [PERSON] , but ...	6
Those men hadn't even thought of that .	7
Everything's ready	2
In case I want to read it more than once .	2
Don't push it !	1
If you find any keys , hang on to them .	2
They'll all be hitting on me .	4
I looked everywhere for my wife but couldn't find her .	6
We can use [PERSON]'s own plan for train robbery .	4
I'm gonna take the gag out .	1
Stay here ?	2
I'll be out in a minute .	2
Unless you're afraid of getting burnt .	4
Don't you realise that I don't have that sort of money ?	7
We'll meet at the rear of the hotel .	2
Leave it to me . I'll tell you .	8
Why didn't you ask me ?	7
Oh , and he's handsome too , no doubt .	5
So what do you want to do ?	2
See you later , darling .	2
We love you .	8
So you fell in love with him .	5
This is where it all started for me .	6
Our own Mayor [PERSON] .	8
l swear on the Virgin , nobody knows !	1
Why , you want a road trip ?	2
Does that make you more comfortable ? - Man :	8
You never know what is looking ... or what you think .	3
Do you remember what to say ?	7
Hop on .	2
Hey , girls ! Hey , baby .	5
He's a prick .	3
That's very interesting .	5
Oh , [PERSON] , yeah . No problem .	8
I want to get down on my knees and thank God .	4
It is probable that the last dose is fatal .	4
Self - defense .	1
Sweetheart , the opinion of a madman doesn't impress me or anyone else .	3
Everything's going so fast , man !	2
I do not count , only King account .	8
I know a place that does a good breakfast .	5
I will wait for you !	2
Instant gratification takes too long .	3
These can be disposed of only by incapacitating the brain .	3
You may not suspect it , but I'm still attractive to some .	8
You're a fucking bastard !	3
The columns and the wolves were after me night and day .	4
Death everywhere and you and me in the middle .	4
You worked hard .	8
Is the water boiling ? Yes	7
He took her out buggy - riding in the late afternoon without a chaperon ... and then he refused to marry her !	3
I want to go home . Are we going soon ?	2
Everyone was in mourning .	6
[PERSON] , aren't you going to tell him about the jewelry ?	7
Your mom and I won't be very long .	2
Don't I know ?	7
There's better things waiting for you when you get out .	2
Get off your ass , get a job and get a fucking life .	1
I like tacos and I like beer .	5
[PERSON] , I thought you'd be amused .	7
Look around , dummy . You see any wires ?	4
Everybody !	7
Then why put up such a front ?	7
She gave me a very beautiful scarf .	5
Want me to be his .	8
You're welcome to join me .	8
It'll only get you in trouble .	4
Please ?	4
Help !	4
Yes , I would .	8
Well , I don't give a damn about the reason .	1
They were looking at me .	4
That I will faithfully execute ...	8
Why don't you shut up and go back where you came from ?	1
Well , that's not a very even trade .	7
You're not even real ghosts !	7
I had trouble like that when I was in school .	6
When the Vice-president calls you , I'll meet you in the centre aisle .	2
Is that chilli ?	7
They ended up having a pretty good thing .	5
I am innocent !	7
Oi !	7
No , I'm not ready !	4
Wherever did you find her ?	7
He swears he has no idea where [PERSON] is , but his phone records tell a different story .	7
I don't want you saying nothing about the Kid and nobody else in my damn county .	1
They sent you . - What ?	7
It was nobody's fault but my own .	6
Don't be rummaging through my private documents , [PERSON] .	1
You'll do your housework , eat chocolates , take care of the kid and you'll put on or pounds .	8
You don't know him like I do .	3
Did anybody ever tell you that you smell like [LOCATION] ?	7
This is the right path for you .	8
Do not leave fingerprints !	1
I thought you was dead .	7
You want to come inside ?	2
Stupid .	3
They probably will start crying .	6
They are very interested .	8
I never signed any contract !	7
She's the one .	8
Takes a stool to find a stool , huh , Lieutenant ?	2
My dad had the right idea .	8
Don't mind them .	8
Turn him off .	1
Is that what you wanted ?	7
Maybe you'll find the explanation for his disappearance inside .	2
Hey , fella .	8
I've got to get a contract signed .	2
I'll tell you , two out of three of those judges do not use the internet .	1
Shall we , eh , have a look at again ?	2
I'm relaxed .	5
And it starts creating the specter of a threat .	4
But it's wonderful .	5
They can't do this to me .	6
Captain , there's a few bodies up there .	4
Uh , I'm not remembering anything .	6
Promise me one thing .	8
Yes . We will be there .	2
Ning !	7
You're the kind of person that gets innocent bystanders killed .	3
Will you let me sleep ?	2
Lord [PERSON] , if you trust me let me go to him	8
You'd better take this extra $ .	8
The defence has an interesting point .	8
Ladies , stay down .	4
This ain't the time to retire .	1
You got a minute , man ?	2
Fine mess you got me into .	3
The way I thought it might be .	7
Get down !	1
I was a friend of the Human Beings until they stole my wife .	3
Let's give her a shout , shall we ?	2
I'll put money in his bank anytime .	2
Well , boy , let's see if we can do something to refresh that rusty , old memory of yours .	2
Lousy freaks !	3
Come to Papa .	8
Why don't you try to get some sleep now ? You're gonna need it .	2
Uh , six reported injured , two are in sick bay , two more seriously being rushed to [LOCATION] .	4
Come on in .	2
That sounds swell , [PERSON] .	5
And now , I'll show you the greatest attraction of all .	2
A cook ?	7
Eat all of your stew , children .	3
Something too frightful to utter .	3
If anyone had told me this morning that I'd decide to go to [LOCATION] ...	2
I understand why I have to be in here .	7
And I'm being asked to brief the CIA director on stuff because he and the president are being lied to ?	7
[PERSON] , we're here because of you .	8
Doggone , I know there's something wrong !	4
These bills are put together by legal minds after long study .	8
I'm gonna ride on back and keep watch .	2
Comrades , your telegram was received with great disfavor in [LOCATION] .	3
You're all I ever had .	8
You were very good in Public Domain .	8
I'm not really . It'll be a long time before I can even be with another dog .	6
♪ She swapped me for a trout ♪	3
We're on vacation .	2
I am far more powerful than you can ever imagine .	7
I can't believe it myself .	7
I hate labels !	3
Out of the question .	1
It was Father's Day ... the last time I heard from her .	6
Now to business .	2
Ah ... I see it pays to advertise on television .	7
Oh , this idiot ?	7
How do you do ?	2
I'll fire you . I'll leave you on the goddamn tarmac .	1
I've examined him several times and ... I think he's begun to trust me .	8
This is adorable .	5
A lot of people are going to pay for this night .	3
Don't you see what's happening ? If you don't find me a killer , there is no fucking office !	1
I didn't know you were married .	7
To hell ! I cast thee back to hell !	1
It doesn't make sense .	7
I can tell the occupation of a man by looking at him .	7
You are correct .	8
Will you stay the week ?	2
I got what you gave me but I can't follow the instructions .	1
But your love does not match your lust for power .	3
I'm quitting the game , [PERSON] .	1
But the rescue has to happen immediately .	4
Why look at me that so strangely ?	7
We do our best .	8
Come on . Are we doing this again ?	7
Think they'll give me a job of responsibility ?	7
The first time I ask you to do one thing for me , like rob a train ...	1
Will you do it for me ?	8
Before experience taught me that life is quite tragic enough ...	6
I was too nervous .	4
I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp !	1
You can not think of anything else than in you .	6
I'm sure [PERSON] would want you to stay .	8
We're here to have fun .	5
Left ! Turn left !	4
I think you're stupid .	3
I'm also perfectly willing and able to cancel this entire production right now , and pay you off and write you off .	1
Look , I got ta go .	2
Is that why you hate them so much ?	7
[PERSON] ? I forgive you for failing .	8
Yes , it was wonderful .	5
Got ta have good nerves , though .	8
First [PERSON] , now [PERSON] .	2
Listen , [PERSON] , or [PERSON] , whichever one you are ...	4
They failed .	6
Why don't I drive up to this place with you and check it out ?	2
I know I speak for my entire radio audience when I express my great admiration for both of you .	8
And it's like she wants to be my mentor , which is exactly what I needed .	8
Hi , Dad .	8
What's it gonna cost me ?	4
Here , you have a go .	2
Yeah , I'm fine , Dad .	8
She was coming after me with this gun right in her two hands .	4
Somebody ought to get their ass kicked for this mess .	3
We got him !	2
I'm afraid I can not accept your evaluation of Cdr . Owynn .	3
We're free .	8
It's awfully quaint , isn't it ?	5
They were never there , this never happened .	7
I don't know what I'm going to do .	4
Clear ?	2
Come on inside .	2
He should be part of our celebration .	5
Keep your head on straight . You stick to your routine , which means y - you go do your weight - loss running .	1
If he called , I'd tell you .	2
Then I got pretty tired of you and your pianos .	3
He's great if you happen to like a tall , blond , Prussian , Nordic , Aryan , Nazi type .	5
What do you expect of me ?	2
It's dangerous , but it just might work .	4
Oh , I'm sure they do .	5
I want these pots so shiny I can see my face in them !	7
She's a pretty little thing , isn't she ?	5
I am glad to see you .	5
Nothing's happened recently to shake my self - confidence .	7
We're the only ones who can afford to be honest .	8
He might have a job for you .	8
I don't think he killed [PERSON] .	7
I blame me . I'm the one who got her killed .	4
If that slob was a penologist , I'm a jet airplane pilot .	3
I'm awfully unhappy , Mom .	6
On the way home we did loop - the - loops so that I could see the moon upside down .	5
I'm afraid he's been stalling .	4
They're out there .	4
So which way you taking ?	2
It's a hell of a way to impress my new partners .	5
It's wonderful stuff .	5
We need to find both of them before they try to pay that ransom .	4
He was here two weeks before I knew he'd moved in .	7
What about the Berserkers ?	4
Her face had shrunk , and her nose was red from crying .	6
Bloody footsteps leading up to the door ?	7
After all she done ?	7
It's the first time he's told me the truth !	7
I'm in .	2
[PERSON] , since you're not going on the cruise , I could use you at the store on Monday .	2
I'm wondering too because this really wasn't part of the plan .	7
I love him .	8
Oh , I just don't think I'm gonna have the time for it .	6
The men aren't gonna be happy about what you've been doing .	3
We thought anybody can understand this .	7
Your money couldn't begin to pay for the window you broke .	3
But this is a family emergency , we do need you at home ,	4
The phone is dead .	6
It's utterly beautiful .	5
He's crazier than I am .	3
Running up stairs keeps my legs slim .	3
Sure as hell is . He called us from there five minutes ago .	1
I wondered why I was suddenly being treated with respect .	7
Get off of that train .	1
Absolute disregard to not show up .	1
My brother seems to have forgotten his courtliness .	6
I know a good thing when I see it .	5
You just move !	1
So much fun and imagination .	5
Only holy people may enter this sacred place . Stay where you are	3
I can verify that .	8
Well , I really put my foot in my mouth this time but , I don't know , I like you two .	3
There's no hard feelings between us .	8
I am content .	5
Hold it !	1
I saw it coming , but what could I do ?	4
How stupid of me !	3
And they told me that you weren't that smart .	3
I don't want him hollering out any windows either .	3
Well , I'd like to help you out , mister . There's nothing I can do .	8
There's no cause for temper , child .	3
Hi , honey .	8
The chick ! - [PERSON]'s girl !	7
I can wind this one up in six weeks .	2
Mr. [PERSON] , it seems that [PERSON]'s mother was murdered by [PERSON]'s father .	4
God , it's in perfect shape .	5
Mom's right , [PERSON] ,	8
They all come in with a whimper , and leave with a grin .	3
Oh , well .	7
Compliments of the gent in the corner by the door .	5
I am satisfied by you , [PERSON] .	8
A little wine with music .	5
So welcome to Elysian Fields .	5
You don't know from one day to the next ... whether you're going to be killed , go home , or get busted .	4
Oh , that's funny .	5
You're crazier than a mule - humping goat .	3

When Mr [PERSON]'s feet hurt , he drives the whole house crazy .	3
I demand that you free the Childlike Empress !	3
We're not going to risk a massive lawsuit .	4

Anyway , what's it matter to you ?	7

But , she can be very generous sometimes .	8
It's high time I told [PERSON] a thing or two .	2
It's a deal .	8
And the only way we got of holding 'em off is by getting together .	3
I mean , all you have to do is to step aside with immense fortune .	3
Without a wind , we'll lose him !	4
This is true , [PERSON] .	8
It will happen , as it does for all of us .	8
It affects her every day .	6
You're the first good thing that's happened to us .	8
We'll make the deal .	8
Outstanding .	5
I do not know what you are , but you are not a woman .	7
Listen , I really can't talk about this over the phone .	1
Where were you ?	7
I don't give a damn .	1
I don't know . We just ... became friends . And then it became more than that .	7
That'll stop him !	4
Now , the police are gonna want me to let some of you go as a sign of good faith .	3

I hope you'll enjoy this .	2
We'll share it .	8
So , I guess I was the lucky one .	5
I'm sorry you have to sneak out by the back way , but we must preserve a respectable front .	6

What good is it to cut off your heads ?	3
Sorry , coach .	6
Not going to do it .	1

Good job .	8
I'm glad you told me about this .	5
I decline to answer your question . I decline to answer your question .	1
And I know this planet is safer because she's defending it .	8
My point is there is a protocol with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .	3
Don't question my decisions again .	1
I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you , but I want you to tell me the truth .	8
No luck ?	7
It's tough being left out , isn't it ?	6
Don't ask me why .	7
He was very understanding .	8
She's going to die if you don't help me .	4
Now come on , you've been drinking .	3
Why did you lie to me ?	7
If you become president , would [PERSON] remain as vice president ?	7
Did you bring that guy in here ?	7
They've done things with my body and the bodies of others ...	3
I was in a really bad place .	4

Yeah , are you gonna feed her ?	2
Just give me the stamp . I love you , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , whatever your name is .	8
So why don't you tell me a little about yourself ?	2
I'll be in my office if you need me .	8
This is long , man .	6
To me , man is a tremendous creation , an inconceivable thought .	3
You sound further away than that .	7
So , how is it you know so little about cars ?	7
We have an idea that might help .	2
[PERSON] is army from the anus up .	3
I had no right to put you through all that .	1
What's [PERSON] got to do with this ?	7
What about it ?	2
I get two bucks an hour , plus ten per cent of that goes to a bail fund .	8
Must be very good .	5
You really could be a nun ! Thanks .	7
Then when I'm good and ready , we come out with a big extra .	2
Collaborating with President [PERSON] is always a mistake .	3
Did you see what he did ?	7
Sink that longboat !	1
Thank you for asking .	8
How did you manage to get so friendly with [PERSON] ?	7
Did I hear something about jewels ?	7
Father .	8
I don't like your faces .	3
Well , now where are you going ?	2
Your back prevented you from practicing six hours a day .	3
If I don't get a room , you and your hotel are fourth on my list to be sued !	1
No worries .	8
Fracture that whole part of the world , and now we have ISIS .	6
I knew there was a story in that guy .	7
So , the ring ? - No .	7
Sing something , [PERSON] . Wonderful idea !	5
I have no basis and no standing to move forward if I did .	1
They're poorly !	3
I'll get on it first thing .	2
I am going to throw up .	3
Well , as long as you feel that way about it , the gun is yours !	1
Jesus ... - Christ on a crutch .	3
Get ready . We need you to drop something off .	2
Okay , I need you to calm down , okay ?	4
I've been having weather problems .	6
Whatever action needs to be taken to address this problem , needs to be taken .	4
I'm just following orders But don't worry	8
So , should we still listen to what Elder says ?	1
She'll talk about the Triad robbery , she'll name Case , then us .	2
But right now , I can't think of one .	6
Please . - Could you get [PERSON] a Coke , please ? - Sure .	2
What's so odd about that ?	7
What do you skin ?	7
How long has she been gone ? ! How long ?	7
I won't ever do it again , I promise .	6
I'm not kiddin' around .	1
Stay out of sight .	4
Be ready to leave on the night train for [LOCATION] .	2
Why would a dumb Polack like you think he could outsmart someone like me ?	3
I'm just fine .	8
Because she can't stand him !	3
I'm your man . Come anywhere near my old lady , I'll cut your balls off , asshole .	1
One good thing .	5
I mean , about my having this floor to go on with my babbling .	3
You took away my czar , my country , my people .	3
I asked him especially , and he told me to tell you .	8
Do you expect me to believe this ?	7
I don't think you'll be able to stand it long .	6
Well , the tall guy is not really a friend .	3
He tried to knife me .	4
Can I just leave my underwear ?	7
Well , I must say you're quite different from what I expected .	7
Get away from that wood !	1
I'm clearing out of that office everything I own .	1
I think you're all being unfair .	3
If they do come here , you will let me know ?	2
Okay . All right !	8
Not even a perhaps or a maybe ?	7
Sounds right to me . OK .	8
Beautiful . - Uh-huh . Yeah .	5
We've to get out of here and get help !	4
We'll have to hope that that's enough .	2
Mr. [PERSON] ? You all right ?	4
We lost [PERSON] !	7
You are a class - A fuck - up , you know ?	3
Something I can do to help you ?	8
I saw those guys coming towards [PERSON]'s house just before we got out .	7
I mean you're gonna find it kind of hard to drive without any keys .	3
I'm gonna do it now .	2
Not me .	6
You're sure of that , are you ?	8
On !	1
How many times have I told you to keep away from my desk ?	1
I'm coming to you .	8
He'll know how to handle things .	8
What about us ?	2
Don't you believe it .	7
You named it .	8
Your gutless hide is safe .	8
How does he end his letter ?	7
Here , rally round and I'll show you the points of interest .	2
I want to talk to my brothers .	2
With a ring like that I could , dare I say it , rule the world .	8
He's a good man .	8
Not your fault , don't think that .	3
And ten minutes later I got the call ... that the court had found in our favor .	1
What kind of car ?	7
You conning him out of the deed without putting down a cent .	3
Yeah , you fucking coward !	1
You don't have to call me Father .	8

Isn't this the same desk ... ?	7
Please . Understand I was taken by surprise .	7
No , sir .	4
Press down on her !	1

Are we ?	7
Well , I will be very glad to hear it .	5
I like her .	5
I don't need marked cards to beat you , pal .	3
He'll show you when it's finished .	2
She was worried about you .	4
A little early for Christmas shopping , ain't it ?	2
You'll never get me to give this up !	1
It's not exactly the Ritz , but it's peaceful and quiet .	5
You little spying ' hyena . Did the professor put you up to this ?	3
Sort of .	7
You make me sick when you speak , [PERSON] .	3
But we've got to take a closer look at this big boy .	2
The best , smartest , most interesting women in the world ?	7
No need to worry , son .	8
Come on , it's me , [PERSON] .	2
Why would anyone recognize me ?	7
So what do we do about the hostage situation , sir ?	4
You broke your husband out of prerelease ?	7
What the blaze is going on here ?	7
I hate that cheap little bastard .	3
But , of course , she's lying .	3
Well , it can't be helped now .	6
Very nice , [PERSON] .	8
And treat those two impostors Just the same ...  	3
You know this guy !	7
It just makes me feel real glad to see the Chiefs back on the warpath again ... to coin a phrase .	5
Is this the kind of person that you are ?	7
No , I think it's a lot more exciting than that .	5
It doesn't fear my incantations !	8
We should go .	2
Mister , is this Heaven here or not ?	7
Hey , they're ... they're shutting the door .	7
Can't you humor him ? I need a favor .	1
You still serve that dull , grey stupidity .	3
Don't you understand ?	7
Specialist to the nursery .	8
I think [PERSON] was kind of cute .	5
Put it down	1
We got to find [PERSON] .	2
Everything's gonna be okay .	8
Who's got time to wonder what happened to some ridiculous talking mice when you're driving by at 75 , miles an hour ?	3
I was state - raised ... and this is a dead place .	3
Keep it down , you'll wake the munchkins !	3
I wouldn't be stupid enough to bring it home .	3
We'll let him sleep .	8
It pretends this man is in danger when no one cares about him one bit .	6
He doesn't have your heart .	3
You take care of these people .	8
They screwed him up .	4
Why did you take him then with me ?	7
Whether we live or die may depend on what happens here .	4
He knows , what I do not understand it is for what reason the Inglethorp it seemed so interested in being a prisoner .	7
The three so - called flying saucers had been recovered in [LOCATION] .  	7
You know I told you that [PERSON] and I are going to get married ... when he comes back from the maneuvers .	2
I hope to see more of you , when you're free of the spell of Mr. [PERSON] .	2
What did he say ?	7
That's part of the picture .	8
Are you crying ?	6
Well , I can't help wondering if [PERSON] is right .	7
Stand by and see his wife insulted ?	3
I was thinking of picking up a pizza and going home .	2
Ah ! - You should listen to your brother .	1
Now you can show Papa some of them tricks .	8
I'll see to it .	8
What's weak about wanting ?	7
And we're finished playing the key cities .	2

Drop that gun and let me walk out .	1
Just let me take her back with me .	8
She'll listen to you , you're not her mother .	1
You could change decent and decent . Go straight .	8

Actually , I kissed you because I couldn't control myself	6
Whatever I lost , I lost a long time ago , and I don't plan on losing more .	6
Next time remind me to bring some aspirin .	2

What about the treasure ?	7
The train's slowing down . How far to the station ?	4

If you , Miss [PERSON] , know of any proof about aliens , you can give it to me and I guarantee you I will get it out , but I am skeptical .	1
[PERSON] , what's the most recent communication we've received ?	7
Violence prone , obsessive / compulsive personality , a history of excessive physical force throughout his years as a [LOCATION] police officer .	3
You're a month early for the book fair .	2
[PERSON] says he didn't rent a car . The rental company says he did . Whatever .	7
Now that particular statement really pissed me off , because I don't think Congress did any such thing .	1
Will succeed .	8
I just came over to share my happiness with you , [PERSON] .	5
And we take care of our own here .	8
Hey , I'm a mama .	8
Don't bother to get up I'll take care of myself	8
Easy .	8
We have so much .	6
Pecmans ? Buttissimo ? Ah , the old abba dabbas	7
One more word and I'll cut you down !	1
He was very clever , so it was very hard to find out about .	3
I promise you that .	8
If that's true ... this should be very exciting .	5
You know what I'll do in the morning ?	2
I want to hear everything you've been doing .	8
[PERSON] is with [PERSON] .	8
Did you hear that , honey ?	7
Can't shoot a kid , can you , fucker ?	1
You don't get the truth in the Senate .	3
We don't want none of his gratitude !	3
You are a coward like all other people , aren't you ?	3
They say it is the skin of a dead snake .	3
Jesus . Yes , this is me .	8
She's got a witch's brain .	3
Can I get you a drink ?	2
I wan na go home .	2
I carried you in here when you were a baby .	8
We could pick it up on the way home .	2
Way too much weird stuff goes on here .	7
I'm gonna be good , you wait .	2
Mind out , cuz .	1
The usual , sir ?	2
Oh , he ain't alone .	8
Take him !	1
He was here ?	7
How was [LOCATION] ?	2
Do you see how this affects [PERSON] ? You don't ?	7
We won't leave this palace alive .	4
You stupid lizard ! Get off me !	1
The girl you thought you knew was quite nameless and without reality .	6
Hello , sweet thing .	5
It's not right . I'm gonna go check it out .	4
They're harmless , friendly , and , by all reports , extremely intelligent and sophisticated .	8
As he waves to the crowd , you can hear the tremendous cheer !	5
My God , she's coming inside . Oh , God .	4
I don't want to start rehashing everything .	6
But it's bleeding ?	4
Hey , no !	7
We'll catch 'em sooner or later .	2
Get us some frickin' pretzels or something .	3
Am I , [PERSON] ? - No .	7
That's much better .	5
He was generous .	8
It was no self - defense , [PERSON] took him out .	3
He was a loser too .	3
You get your ass over there , Gate .	1
What did he tell you to tell me ?	7
Is it , perhaps , that this cause is too hopeless ?	4
Bathing suits looked awfully funny 100 , years ago .	5
You sleep in till noon , then you watch [LOCATION] and Bullwinkle .	3
What'll it be ?	2
[PERSON]'s depending on you , [PERSON] .	8
I know you're all right ... and a good woman at heart , even though you might have took a wrong turn in life .	8
Well , I reckon I'm in .	2
Out ! Get out !	1
We throw ourselves at your mercy .	3
We thought you'd be safer on the ground .	8
Just put me through on the phone , [PERSON] . Goddamn it !	1
I'm cold .	6
Since you're their representatives , I can tell you that I'm prepared , right now , to give you a [PERSON] .	8
The belle from hell Versus the dove from above In a one - soul , anything goes match - up , [PERSON] .	8
Come say hello to [PERSON] . Have you met ?	2
Go get him , Dad !	4
What the fuck ? !	1
There were bodies that were involved with some of these crashes .	4
He's taken it again !	7
With this strike they've no way home , and there's not a room in the city .	3
Still working on my dissertation at my age . It's ridiculous .	3
If you think I'm the kind to mess with anybody comes along ...	3
I'm afraid of you ?	4
The Kid will have to play him .	3
They have a craving for human flesh .	3
He wants clean people on the screen for himself and his children to look at .	3
Don't give me that . I know enough about weights and measures to know holes aren't allowed , no corrective holes .	1
[PERSON]'s people were ready to go , but the FSB replaced the crew .	2
Get the hell up because I'm out here alone .	1
Are you out of your mind ?	1
I'll break it to her gently .	8
Background , [PERSON] . Tell me about it .	2
Freeze !	4
Hop on , no time to lose .	8
I'm going to be next week .	2
See anything you like ?	2
What kind of a deal is this ?	7
I know about abnormal behaviour .	3
We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange .	4
I love the smell of commerce in the morning !	5
That is ridiculous .	7
Yeah , she'll wind up fat , alcoholic and miserable .	3
What other reason could there be ?	7
Remote and useful .	8
I change cars like other guys change their fuckin' shoes !	3
And now , a happy surprise for all of us .	5
Time's over for drifters and outlaws and those who got no backbone .	3
You're going to Harvard and you're gonna be a doctor .	2
I think there's a lot of planets out there .	7
I told you not to count it .	1
For the hospital , for the seriously sick .	4
I got a surprise for you tonight .	2
Look how big it is !	7
I want them booked on felony charges , destruction of private property , and assault .	3
We are witnessing the making of a legend , [PERSON] , the kind of thing that front covers are made of .	7
The most beautiful TV personality , Miss [PERSON] !	5
I had fights ... . . and every one of 'em I was scared , so yeah , you know , that's real , real normal .	6
You will pay me back what you owe , with interest .	8
Come right in .	2
Very nice of him , though .	5
Yes , I noticed you'd packed .	7
Well , actually ...	7
Get that piece of pigshit out here .	1
Dear Senator , have you got any idea what it takes to get a bill passed ?	4
I want some more beer .	2
There will come a time , when those who sit above me will want you delivered .	2
That night I got a grip on life again .	6
She's fainted .	6
Put them back .	1
Tell me the whole story from the beginning .	2
At my age , you got ta think about retiring .	3
It felt good .	5
That's why your wife dumped you .	3
Liar !	3
[PERSON]'s going to help with my chemistry .	8
I've never known anyone as capable and intelligent .	8
It's out ! - Are you all right ?	4
Take that sentence back !	1
He reached out to us and asked if we'd be willing to help him	8
[PERSON] , I can't subpoena those records without a legitimate client .	1
My back's giving me hell .	3
[PERSON] won't see her kids again .	6
He hit me .	4
Your beloved business manager , [PERSON] the man you stayed with , the one I begged you to leave ....	6
Put this on .	2
You think I like playing sick little games with you ?	3
I am broke , desperate and very pissed .	4
If [PERSON] found out , it would kill her .	4
( sighs ) I thought I got some good news .	5
I warn you , if this case comes to trial , it will be before a French court .	4
Consuella is right .	8
But the water was dangerously low ?	7
Just feel how nice it is in here .	5
And as for taxes , how many millions have you in tax - exempt bonds and oil wells , whose power of production your government so generously protects , while it denies similar benefits to the human brain ?	3
How come she leave that job ?	7
Oh , very good !	5
I was getting a message for you .	2
I think it's brilliant .	5
You taught me everything .	8
Particularly child trafficking .	3
I'm so sorry .	6
[PERSON] , you must be mistaken .	1
When we first went there , [PERSON] , he could barely speak .	6
We've been through this !	7
The only ones who see a UFO on TV programs are the rednecks .	3
Why , her last words were about you .	7
Home team .	1
I just wish I could tell him how much I appreciate this .	8
You can hold the frog .	8
Let's sing !	2
He says he doesn't want presents , but you know him .	3
Christ .	3
With who ?	7
A man dropped you off unconscious . Who ?	7
I was afraid of that .	4
[PERSON] asked me if I wanted to see him again .	2
Let's get something to eat .	2
How can you have the gall to compare the conflict here in [LOCATION] with a glass of cappuccino coffee ?	3
I was getting lonely upstairs , all by myself .	6
I'll speak with you first .	2
Allow me to get that bag for you .	8
So the basic problem is that I'm still around ?	7
Everyone wanted to do the oral argument , that's always kind of the cherry on top of the ice cream there .	3
[PERSON]'s divorce left him in a state of disorder .	6
Pick you up in an hour .	2
I told you , this can get tough .	8
They'll destroy you .	4
Four degrees down !	7
Here , at least , I'm a little star .	5
Any day now the doctors say they may find the antitoxin .	4
These little rascals make life worth living .	3
I would put money on us .	8
Wasn't [PERSON] the sweetest man you ever met ?	5
I wish I were a woman of 36 , dressed in black satin with a string of pearls .	7
They say some of us can turn as late as nine or ten , but I'm past that now so ...	3
Good luck , [PERSON] .	5
I never thought of it ...	7
I'll talk to you later .	2
I do better with women , and they don't eat cigars ...	3
It will be a fine thing to do .	8
Like a velvet glove cast in iron , and like the gas chamber , [PERSON] , a real fun gal .	5
A wonderful day , I think .	5
It's as true now as it was then .	8
I have something I'd like to show you .	2
Bless you . Father , how can I possibly thank you ?	8
[PERSON] , is you going out of your mind ?	7
Jeanne !	7
You can beat it out of me , but it won't do you any good .	1
You and I are such similar creatures .	8
What's this about a film ?	7
We're partnering on a project .	2
It's a big nut to crack .	3
You have to have faith .	8
The Presidential Commission has empowered me to take it in my care .	8
Unless you wanted me to stay .	1
Isn't this exciting ?	5
Men will believe anything , the more preposterous the better .	3
That hurts .	6
Nothing we didn't expect .	7
Let me handle your husband's career and you can live like human beings again .	8
I don't care what you found , boy !	1
The pretty one on the right . I think she likes you .	5
You can hardly expect the jury to believe that a woman in love doesn't attempt to meet her lover .	3
Yes , I confess .	8
Fine .	5
Then you must be his ...	8
I've always thought a lashing with a whip would benefit you immensely .	3
I need to know .	8
Well , young man , you seem to be enjoying yourself .	5
Well , there it is .	2
We've got to leave .	4
That would be nice .	5
This sure is a happy day to me .	5
I hope you lose .	4
I will not go back where I came from , because I do not like it there .	3
Would you call me [PERSON] ?	2
And that's exactly what I'm going to do .	2
There is no other way out , my friend .	4
He was the sanest man I ever knew .	8
You ain't really gonna let them take that baby , are you ?	4
Nobody's on it because she's a junkie , and everything she said to me is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto , which has been picked apart by every message board and conspiracy theorist on the Internet .	3
I think we're stuck .	4
I thought , l 'm in love . 	5
Keep joshing like that And you're never going to college like your sister here .	3
I know the answer .	8
I know you were deeply touched by [PERSON]'s gesture ,	8
I'd known [PERSON] since I was an altar boy .	8
You a fifty - dollar whore ? - What are you doing ?	3
More importantly , what the hell am I doing here ?	1
[PERSON] , they weren't taking any chances !	4
Now , with such simplicity ... Such clarity , everything falls into place .	8
Help me .	8
We should get rid of anybody that doesn't put the company first .	1
You know , [PERSON] is not gonna last five minutes out there .	1
You look tired , Little Big Man .	6
Right . And the living room nose and the kitchen forehead and den ears .	3
Sir , I was the best swimmer in my course .	8
That might not be the worst of it .	6
I'm a fighter .	8
Fire the security department !	1
You don't care whether I live or die .	1
[PERSON] was the fireball of our little cocoon .	5
Hell , we could bring in the whole god damn New York Knicks just to make sure your trash hits the basket ! How's that ?	3
I just can't believe [PERSON]'s dead .	6
[PERSON] , do you know what you're saying ?	7
I know you're trying to scare me , huh ?	4
You okay ?	4
You do , you look amazing , isabel .	5
Get out of my way , [PERSON] .	1
Mr. [PERSON] , you wan na join the party ?	2
Something hit us .	4
Stand by to torpedo !	4
He told you to tell me that too ?	7
Now , today ...	2
Harry , how did you do it ?	7
Old man , my last name isn't Chow !	3
The Lady herself Inglethorp !	7
I want you to know how sorry I am I had to put you through this .	6
No , no , no .	4
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day ?	7
I think I'm going to go back in and see the movie .	2
Therefore , it must be a metal .	7
No , don't ! Not this one .	1
Nothing will ever happen to me anymore !	6
You're going into the arena alone .	1
I thought I liked to party , but these guys ...	7
I don't give a shit if he knows who killed him or not .	1
You tell him I've got [PERSON] under control .	8
You won't get away with this , Trixie .	3
Is she the one in the painting ?	7
He must be going out of his mind .	6
The good people of [LOCATION] !	5
And , [PERSON] , I want you to get me the CEO of IBC ASAP .	8
It seems there's no formal contract between you and [LOCATION] .	7
I'm glad you're making new friends .	5
The Montauk Club , : pm .	2
I didn't marry her under my real name .	6
[PERSON] , my sympathy for your loss --	6
Sucker !	1
We're not gonna hurt you .	8
The police have road blocks on every main exit from town .	4
It's a nice sentimental gesture , CinCPac sending your old cruiser .	5
I had the most frightening experience .	4
It sounds frightening .	4
Something is breeding there . Underneath the cemetery .	4
There's the finest deerskin jacket I've ever seen .	5
I couldn't agree with you more .	1
It'd be a big help if you could keep an area clear in front of the bridge for us .	8
I couldn't get the cook on such short notice , so we're on our own .	7
You think you know something about law .	7
l 'm in love with a cop from the . 	5
[PERSON] needed my help .	8
It's better than dying in some dirty hotel .	3
The idea that Backpage is just trying to cater to fetishes of old men , doesn't really involve underage children ,	3
[PERSON] is a man of luck .	8
Don't lose a moment .	8
Yes , but when the cash runs out , they'll mob us .	3
Stand here and argue .	1
You said you'd never leave me .	8
[PERSON] , keep that mule's asshole away from me before I have to break him .	3
Oh , I am sorry .	6
All my failings were preparations for meeting you .	6
His ambition has jeopardized the prosperity of the English people .	3
It's like working in a filling station , watching the cars go by .	3
What's he doing there ?	7
Are you guys nuts ?	1
Sure .	8
Today's just taking shit down .	3
Once again skill and daring have overcome fear and anxiety .	8
Take your hands off there , you old fool .	1
You ain't gonna take no car .	1
Fucking come on , then !	1
It's over . Water under the bridge .	4
The Feds are at the lake house , man .	2
Don't leave without saying goodbye .	6
You want fantasy , let's go to my place .	2
A river patrol just fished a girl out of the water .	3
Like hell it isn't .	1
No way [PERSON] is going to talk me into cutting celery again .	1
I don't want to lose you .	6
Don't go to him in anger . Go and warn him .	1
Ah , the ring !	7
What am I gonna do , [PERSON] ?	4
Give me all the covering fire you can spare .	8
Are you willing to take that chance ?	2
Here we go again !	7
You can't leave me here alone .	6
You should have learned by now !	1
I could sure use your help .	8
She was a hooker and made it sound so great .	5
What is it now ?	7
If you have something to say , say it and get out .	1
That's what I pay you for .	1
[PERSON] , why are you so cross ?	7
We're unbeatable .	6
I behaved abominably .	6
They're meeting my first demand .	2
Fucking asshole . I love you .	3
All the good in this world came from fools with faith like that .	3
I cast thee back to hell . To hell !	1
I'll get in trouble !	4
I'm sorry I can't wait here with you , but ...	6
The wise man gets drunk to spend his time with fools .	3
Okay , then let's get going .	2
Why don't you both shut up ?	1
What are you doing ? - Shh .	4
Father . I'm seeing a pattern here .	2
There has seldom been a man so unwise , so headstrong but he could see the necessity of keeping friends and not making enemies at court .	3
Thank you . Good night .	8
Let him go !	1
Let's go get them , baby .	2
Can I ask you something ?	2
Don't nobody want to ask me nothin' ?	7
Have Doc take a look at him .	4
Well , my mother was a music teacher and married my father , whose family was extremely wealthy .	8
You know , I'm getting damn tired of your misplaced admiration .	3
Why don't you shut the hell up ! Crybaby .	1
When will you come back to me ?	2
I don't want to go to [LOCATION] .	6
I - I came to this country to pursue the American dream .	8
Excuse me , Doctor , but that would be a tragic mistake .	6
Can't do what ?	7
They breed like rabbits , don't do any work and expect Welfare to put them on [LOCATION] .	3
I have no idea what to do .	4
[PERSON] , thanks ever so much .	8
I'm going after her .	2
Well , she did sort of embrace it once she did .	5
No , that's not it , give me that chain .	4
It's ... it's gonna take me a while to map out all of her movements .	2
This is [PERSON] , Chief of Homicide Bureau Office of the District Attorney , County of [LOCATION] .	4
As you can see , I'm being relieved of command .	1
Since you're sitting in the corner . You're usually a power table kind of girl .	3
I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me .	2
You put asses into seats .	3
Please come back , [PERSON] .	8
The best !	5
So , are you going to tell the police ?	7
It's nice to have company for tea .	5
Would you like to dance ?	2
You can't do this to him , or to all the others .	1
Quiet , please !	4
You treat her bad .	3
He got a little sick .	6
[PERSON] turns against me , And I should lighten up ?	7
I don't think I should join your campaign , you know .	1
As for me , I'm just a slave .	3
I'm thinking , I did it .	7
What do you want it to be ?	7
Would you like me to go back and get [PERSON] out ?	2
All that money , [PERSON] ?	7
I wanted to surprise you .	2
You look terrific .	5
Nothing's impossible .	7
I just don't fit behind a desk , I I'm not cut out for it , I feel dry - docked .	6
Oh , no . Come on . You don't know that .	7
That's excellent .	5
You must have had some wonderful experiences in [LOCATION] .	5
He's a bit soft that Inspector , isn't he ?	8
The man ends up looking like his heart attacked him .	3
All you got ta do is run into him .	4
It can only blow up in our faces .	4
I've been missing you a lot lately .	6
Well , I'd say the [LOCATION] money will probably lay about ... oh , 8 - 5 , on [PERSON] .	2
I'm renting a fucking bed - sit , Al.	1
You knew when I point blank asked you , and you lied to me about it .	1
I can't keep this from the president any longer .	1
You don't look excited .	7
You know I'm gonna be the president , right ?	8
I am ready , Mr. [PERSON] .	2
By the time they take the mortgage payments out of my paycheck , there's not enough left to buy you a fuckin' box of tampons !	3
Yeah , I um , I just ... just thought I saw something , but I can't really , um , trust my eyes these days .	7
You murdering fool !	3
Tomorrow , [PERSON] ... My friend and mentor , will testify he thinks I'm guilty .	4
You'll learn quick enough .	8
He is unworthy of command .	3
No , stay there . You must stay .	1
Don't move !	4
Bastards .	3
Will she be back soon ?	2
He's worse than [PERSON] Tex.	3
You got me down in this goddamn water .	1
I don't get your generation's humour .	3
You want us to believe that ?	7
No , you're not listening to me !	1
One time he had the whole cast over from some [LOCATION] show .	7
Well , like I said , right now , I've got a bigger problem .	4
Come on , damn it !	1
What's that got to do with us ?	7
What's your hurry , honey ? He's not gonna run away !	4
No , but he's not feeling well .	6
But we will be still more intelligent .	8
This test may tell us why .	2
That money was going to change my life .	6
So , you're a lawyer now ?	7
It's a dead man .	4
He won't open the safe .	4
I have something inevitable to tell you .	2
I ain't gonna call her any more .	1
I want everything he's got .	8
You can call it an immigration if you want to , [PERSON] .	8
He wasn't worthy of your loyalty .	6
Wouldn't you enjoy that ?	5
All right . Mind your shoving ' , mate .	1
I want to talk to you .	8
Are you able to offer something ?	2
You chickenshit bastard .	3
I can't have that .	6
We know from our fancy telescopes that just in the last years , more than planets have been identified outside our solar system that seem to be far enough from their suns and dense enough that they might be able to support	7
That means we're in grave trouble .	4
Fuck your goddamn cleaner !	1
Yes , I guess it's been a nightmare for you too .	6
I don't have casual affairs .	6
I will .	8
Knows him real well .	8
Bring him to me !	1
In other words , it doesn't hurt a bit .	5
And how about some pepper and salt and vinegar , eh ?	2
I'm a friend of the family .	8
I've got some sandwiches in my pack .	2
Ring it , mate .	8
I'm an actor , see ?	7
Such an honour that you rode my horse !	5
He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens and you with it !	1
Give me a nice big hug , like you used to when you were little .	5
Holy Moses .	3
What was that crack ?	7
Your day is done , old boy .	8
But I'm expecting a courier any minute .	2
How sad .	6
I love this !	5
Because we've lived through it .	8
I bet you don't even like girls , do you ?	7
[PERSON] , you're so ... weird !	7
It seems to me very clear .	8
Now , if Case doesn't kill us , the Triads will .	4
Well , I no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart . I don't want anyone else to either .	1
This is why I have never been able to love anyone else before you .	6
My own husband was killed in this last war .	6
[PERSON] , honey , would you like to freshen up Mr. [PERSON]'s drink a little bit ?	2
The time had come to look the devil in the eye and send him to hell where he belonged .	3
I don't believe what we have done .	7
Now , we better start all over .	2
You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order .	3
They send you champagne .	5
He's lying .	3
And you're gonna ask me questions .	2
If it's OK with you , I'd just like to hold 'em here in my hand .	8
He's being evasive again .	3
ve never been to [LOCATION] L.A.[LOCATION] 	7
He won't eat any steak .	3
I guess one gets the face one deserves .	8
I'm trying , you know it really upsets me .	6
What do you think they're all talking about ,	7
Aren't you supposed to know that ? Isn't that your job ? How could you be stupid enough to let somebody follow you ?	1
They all point to me .	8
I'm not on the pills so we use rubbers , so it's hurting .	6
Stop the presses !	1
Why , you got something ?	2
Sister [PERSON] , you play great game of balls . How come ?	5
Why's she making those funny noises ?	7
I should feed a strange mouth ?	7
I'm gonna love squeezing you out .	2
I was ambitious then .	8
A man's got ta live up to his word .	8
You can't even cook my breakfast .	3
It's a big mistake .	4
Pretty sea . Pretty sand .	5
[PERSON] , I don't know what I'll do when you go .	4
I don't want you smoking in the car tomorrow .	1
Oh , my gosh , you must be [PERSON] !	7
I know all the other teams laugh at me .	5
With her bare hands , she just chopped him down !	3
Ripping out phones , urinating on desks .	3
Mr. [PERSON] loaned me his Bible here so I could practice my reading .	8
Where do they get this crap ?	1
Request permission to leave . - Captain , sir ?	2
Black powder and worse ...	3
Well , we won't stand for it .	1
Tomorrow we begin again .	2
[PERSON] , I came to say goodbye .	6
These two shooters you just brought up from [LOCATION] .	7
It's a better world , we're all bound for .	8
How is that going to look at home ?	2
I was laughing so hard , my drink came out of my nose .	6
They're warming up for it over at [LOCATION] .	2
Did that nickname have anything to do with the typhoon ?	7
This was the most - watched event in the history of the National Press Club .	5
I made reservations at [LOCATION] on [LOCATION] .	2
Of course . Thank you .	8
Jealousy can be destructive .	3
And do remember me kindly to your charming wife .	8
With a little push , we can launch our amphib assault in hours .	2
You wan na help me ? - I'm driving .	8
I've got a job to do , but I'm not hard to get along with .	8
Over my dead body .	6
Hallelujah , brothers !	5
When we invade [LOCATION] , What will the help of [LOCATION] ?	4
I bet you're gonna get a big promotion when this thing's over .	2
His words are too profound	6
Please hurry .	4
Don't cry , honey .	6
The way you say that sounds so ... rote .	3
Happier than we've ever been , yes .	5
Tell [PERSON] 9:[PERSON] , is fine for dinner and see if you can get us into Jams .	2
In fact , I admire the style of you .	5
Just married .	8
I'm your pal .	8
Ah , [PERSON] , old chum .	8
A dollar's a dollar , and every dollar is taking me further West .	2
I am not prepared for wells to run dry !	3
Let me show you to your new house .	2
I don't want any lesson , Shooter .	1
You always do .	8
I'm on my way back to [PERSON] .	2
I'll see you inside the party .	2
We'll keep her here , won't we ?	8
Weren't you , in fact , intimate with the lady ?	7
There's no time !	4
I have a condo with a pool .	5
You mustn't speak to Little Big Man like that .	3
That's a terrible lot of money for a working woman to pay .	3
I've looked all over for shoes like that .	7
Now it's all one big mess .	3
[PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] .	8
Thank you , thank you , thank you ...	8
The perps are still on the train , okay ?	4
Well , they went to the DA , which means they think you did .	7
Hey , look who's here !	7
You pull one thing , you're out .	1
I'd love to go with you , Mr. [PERSON] .	2
I can see that !	7
I'm ... I'm sorry .	6
Because we belong together .	8
Don't be sure .	4
Don't drink alone .	3
Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him .	8
I'm not ready to retire yet .	6
You better be careful .	4
They're fuckin' horrible - lookin' .	3
You know , maybe it's better you're not staying here .	8
Seriously , must you keep your bicycle in the hall , Father [PERSON] ?	3
And that's the only way to make change , is to make your voice known .	1
We must expose and punish it ...	4
You see that man giving screwface to [PERSON] ?	3
You are ?	7
I don't give the orders , I obey them .	1
This is exactly when we should strike .	2
How stupid .	3
This is okay .	8
Well , I did all my homework .	8
You got him hooked ?	2
You've exceeded everyone's expectations , the way you handled yourself all weekend , but ...	8
What are you accusing me of ?	1
Then you'll finally be rid of me .	6
The poor old governor has to go back to [LOCATION] and live on his pension , right ?	3
What ? What , daddy ?	7
I'd rather negotiate with you any day .	8
Are you saying she was kidnapped ?	7
He shouldn't have to decide here .	6
Give them a taste of their own iron !	1
They laugh and kiss , then they scream and beat each other .	3
And so I turned away my head and wept .	6
Where shall we begin ?	2
Fun but scary .	7
Little Man was very brave .	8
There's a lot of charming people hereabouts , [PERSON] .	5
I'm getting numb all over .	6
I'm moving abroad .	2
Out there , you got me a little wrong .	1
The celebrated list .	5
That's the kind of stuff I like .	5
That might be enough to win this race .	2
As soon as I get it , we'll make tracks .	2
She's very attractive .	5
Oh , is that [PERSON]'s idea ?	7
Why aren't they telling us anything ?	7
It doesn't matter . They run a little family grocery shop back home .	3
Now , please , tell me what I can do .	2
All I'm askin' for is a chance .	2
That's bad management .	3
Yeah , then why are you trying to hurt me ?	7
Come on . I got a schedule to keep .	2
Grow up . Leave your mother .	3
I'm beginning to like it .	5
But he didn't give a shit .	1
With lunch !	2
[PERSON] , [PERSON] man .	8
Got ta have protein . Got ta have eggs .	3
I shall die on the gallows .	4
I admit nothing .	6
I'll do what I can , Mammy .	8
I'm the first to go .	8
Let me give you this watch .	2
The queue was endless .	6
What makes you think we're living in this day and age ?	7
It's to show I love you .	5
Let's go to a nice place .	2
You dumb bastard , why didn't you get some girl off the streets ?	1
[PERSON] has a terrific body .	8
That'll be a good start .	2
I. . . didn't think I'd ever see you again .	6
Yeah , he's bullshit .	1
Let's dance !	2
Good to meet you , Mr. [PERSON] .	5
You couldn't have found anyone more sympathetic to your condition .	6
Look !	7
Bad guy .	3
They had to bring in the coke in wheelbarrows .	3
He's terrific . He's on it .	5
Fuck only knows why [PERSON] lets them in .	1
I'm not investigating her for working for you , I'm investigating her for felony fraud .	1
Oh ! I go there quite often .	7
My heart is packed so full of love for you .	5
[PERSON] , a drink here for my friend .	2
I told you not to pick up the phone .	1
Do you wan na make love ?	2
Taste for fine things .	5
Rosy had eaten and drunk a lot .	6
Or didn't you think magicians could fall in love ?	7
What's that got to do with a train ?	7
Come on , you too !	2
You're going to be one unless you do exactly as I say .	1
Think we should find a rubbish dump or something .	3
There's one on the back , but it's not the right one .	7
Showtime .	2
We're your family now , [PERSON] .	8
He must be in shock . This rush , this adrenaline , the fear .	4
God , I'll lose him .	4
And after dinner we could go ...	2
And anyone who doesn't do right according to nature and my mother I will blow his head off .	3
But they actually had a very thin but tight fitting suit on .	7
You know , so it shouldn't fall apart in his hands .	3
I suppose like the fathead you are , you told Father all your little hopes and dreams ?	3
Look what I found .	7
She died trying to save my daughter .	6
Be a good fellow and get out now .	8
I don't need fuckin' forensics to tell me this was some punk stealing luggage !	1
Which items ?	7
I'll never see you again .	6
You sound sort of peculiar .	7
Why am I here ?	7
That bitch has messed around with me .	3
Then there were some who just got tired of living .	6
[PERSON] , will we be lonely tonight ?	6
Don't you worry about [PERSON] . He can handle himself .	8
Ah . He tucked my parents into bed every night .	6
I hate getting upset .	6
Mr [PERSON] , [PERSON] , I'd like you to meet the greatest guy in the whole wide world .	2
Nothing doing .	6
This way , [PERSON] .	8
Rakonin has just given me the most amazing news .	5
How do you know I won't trick you and turn you in to the hands of the police ?	3
I'm always hiding from him , but he finds me .	6
Do you have a gun ?	7
I think I care too much .	6
Sorry about your finger .	6
It doomed me forever to middle management , and that's the truth .	6
As things are , there's no need for you to go through the Customs .	3
Thank goodness .	5
You idle apathetic !	3
I want to go home , now . I'll talk to [PERSON] .	2
And very heavily .	3
You've got to manage without the doctor .	4
Apparently my birth was not considered a blessed event .	6
I want the Governor's residence , [LOCATION] .	2
I got a ship to run .	2
Isn't this fun ?	5
That's very gracious of you .	8
Spirits soared , women swooned , and gods were created , gentlemen .	5
Because I always get lucky .	5
You look real nice in that ribbon .	5
[PERSON] continued to invade your privacy .	3
I should have taken my chances with the cannibals .	3
Looks like this case will be settled in no time .	2
I want one week to bring you proof and your promise that I will not be expelled and the bill won't be passed .	1
No . - [PERSON] , you're not finished .	1
Those were the last words she heard me say .	6
I got a run of three .	2
If we are to be defeated , then we prefer to be defeated ... as human beings , not as barbarians .	3
The [PERSON] whose testimony nearly sunk us all .	6
Mr. [PERSON] , I really appreciate all the work you do for him , but you and I know that my bloc is growing .	8
Slaughter ! You missed !	7
We're losing the wind !	4
For one thing , it'd get you off the streets .	1
If your men are as cocksure as you are , they might get through .	3
I was wondering if by any chance you guys were hiring .	2
Are you drunk ?	7
I'm drunker than you are , so it'll be a fair fight .	3
I'd have to lead them through .	8
I saw the same book in her room .	7
It means I haven't forgotten whose court I'm on .	7
Not good .	6
Your breath stinks of it .	3
What about dynamite ?	7
Forgive me for not recognizing you , Dr. [PERSON] .	6
Well , because that makes sense .	8
Sure , sure .	8
There's speculation that he's already ...	4
Fatter ? - No , Dad .	7
I want my money . I want to get out of here .	4
You are the most incredible creature I've ever met .	5
In your case , I wanted to test your loyalty to your companions .	8
Anyway , last year he comes to me . He wants some names checked out . Who was where , who's doing what .	2
Best you go ask him yourself .	2
You get a bonus and a raise .	8
I do declare , it looks like my head's gonna split open with all this singing and yelling and hallelujah - ing .	3
And I'll tell you all about that job .	2
The Belgian of the village ?	7
Go fuck a refrigerator , pecker neck !	3
Hold it .	1
Come on !	2
Open the goddamn door , [PERSON] !	1
Extra-terrestrial bodies , yes .	7
I think I'll take a nice dose of sleeping pills tonight .	2
Headless corpses .	3
Have fun !	5
And you and I are going out together .	2
Coming !	2
[PERSON] hates caffeine .	3
That's the stuff he fills the children's heads with !	3
Yeah , no , no !	1
I can't breathe in here .	6
Oh , no . That won't do .	4
He'll use everything in the book and then some he's made up to kill you .	3
When did you get a chance to do this , kid ?	7
[PERSON] , don't .	6
She's a wonderful girl .	5
I know that when there's something wrong , you tell me . But there's something going on that you won't let me understand .	4
Get rid of him , [PERSON] .	1
You ain't gonna have no crop because you got a sin on your soul .	3
We wound up on a train . - A train ?	7
Hey , come on !	2
glad to see you're out of jail .	5
I think I just became the first president to ever publicly mention Area .	7
He gave me some work to do and he left .	6
They're rather fond of me .	8
Isn't it marvellous ?	5
And congratulations . I heard you're going to replace Mr. [PERSON] .	8
Of all directions , why should I have chosen one leading to that parade ground of vulgarity which lies between Nice and [LOCATION] ?	3
[PERSON] , it's tapioca , Your favorite .	5
Then we'll have brunch by my private lake .	2
We can't let you out of here . You know that . Of course .	1
Brought about by what is know as  the miracle of love  .	5
Major [PERSON] will arrange for whatever facilities you may require .	8
Is not it so ?	7
You got ta go see him .	2
Your officers will work beside you .	8
Damn it , get in here !	1
Because you were right about [PERSON] .	8
Then stop calling me .	1
I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life .	2
I warned you !	1
No , don't do it .	4
You'd better hurry over there .	2
Come to think of it , everyone did look kind of undressed .	7
I'll get right back to you .	8
He said you were a saintly old man who didn't hold with all the vices .	3
Now what put that into your mind ?	7
I'm so glad to see you .	5
Only in [LOCATION] do people like us rise from oppression and poverty to join hands in this international event .	3
There isn't a cloud in sight .	4
The psycho - vigilante killer continues his daily diet for murder .	3
And you must trust me when I say it's likely we're all going to die .	4
There's more bad ?	4
The cobbler who fixed my shoes so beautifully yesterday .	5
Oh , yeah .	7
Of course , but we are only telling you because we know you'll want to rescue him .	8
Those two guys and [PERSON] , shit man , I seen them take on a gang of guineas with nothing but a knife and a broken bottle in their hand .	3
You think he's gonna say , I've had it  ? 	7
We ain't never been friends .	6
I don't want you to be angry with me for having predicted it . What ?	7
Oh , great news , I got some turkey burgers , you know we can grill , and watch a little Monday Night Raw tonight if you want ?	2
I'm pleased that we're having this closed executive session .	5
She did what ?	7
Loveliest room you've ever seen .	5
All right , [PERSON] boy , what we got ?	2
But why do you bring this up now ?	7
You know I am obliged to report you to the authorities .	1
Come on , you're kidding me , right ?	7
You don't have a boy !	7
You never wore that before .	7
You're not making any sense .	1
They gave me a piece of candy in the store .	5
Your skin stinks of it .	3
Tell her about our special student housing program .	2
But people just respected him , respected his , uh ...	8
Boys ...	8
And so will you .	8
I still insist he's paranoid .	3
Is that what you want ?	7
I hate him so fucking much .	3
I was so proud .	8
If you're dirty , you're going .	3
Did you come to see me for the same reason as the man with sweat on his face ?	7
Hey , it's all right , baby .	8
I'm not takin' a shower with him .	1
Let's do some good .	2
Hey , you're looking good .	5
Have they moved the embassy , or are you hijacking me ?	7
What that !	7
Imagine interplanetary trade , how exciting that would be ?	2
